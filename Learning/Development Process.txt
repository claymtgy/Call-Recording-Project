To start off this project, my idea was to completely automate recording call statistics to a spreadsheet to monitor results of marketing.
The idea was, at first, to access Google directly for Google Voice information, and record it directly from there and copy it into a report. This plan was quickly ruined, however, because (at time of writing) there is no API that can connect with Google. At least not that I could find. This resulted in a quick brainstorm, where I found out you can still download datat from Google directly, a service they call Google Takeout. So now the plan has become to parse through this information in a takeout zip, gather it, sort it, and boom. The project is mostly saved. The automation of gathering the data in the first place will probably have to wait until later. I will probably try to automate this using a headless browser and scripts. A few minutes of Googling suggests a program called Puppeteer.
First thing's first, I will learn to parse the data and sort it into a spreadsheet.
